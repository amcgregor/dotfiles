h1. Git Hooks

bq. This branch contains my common pool of Git hooks for, most notably, pre-commit and post-merge.

To use these simply check out a copy of this repository somewhere and switch to the @hooks@ branch, then symlink the hooks you want into your own repository's @.git/hooks@ folder.  (Create the folder if it doesn't exist.)
